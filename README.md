# LHA App

This is a small shiny-application that computes severity scores for pneumonia for one or multiple patients. The app is currently hosted [here](https://apps.health-atlas.de/cap-severity-scores/). See [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2703722/) for more information about the scores. This is a work-in-progress currently on hold.
